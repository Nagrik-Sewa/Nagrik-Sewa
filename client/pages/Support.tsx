          answer: "Our refund process is transparent and customer-friendly. Refunds are initiated immediately and reflect in your account within 5-7 business days depending on your bank/payment method. Money is refunded to the original payment source - same card, UPI account, or wallet used for booking. In case of partial service completion or issues, you may receive partial refunds based on service provider policy and investigation. You'll receive SMS and email notifications with refund reference numbers to track the status."

        {
          question: "Are service providers verified?",
          answer: "Yes, we maintain the highest verification standards for your safety and peace of mind. Every service provider submits government-issued ID proofs (Aadhaar, PAN, Driving License) which are verified by our security team. We conduct comprehensive background verification including criminal record checks and previous employment verification through authorized agencies. Practical skill tests and certifications ensure providers meet our quality standards and can deliver professional services. We also verify previous work experience and contact references to ensure reliability and professional conduct."

          question: "What if I'm not satisfied with the service?",
          answer: "Your satisfaction is our priority. Contact our support team within 24 hours of service completion through app, website, or helpline for fastest resolution. Our quality team will investigate your complaint by reviewing service details, contacting the provider, and assessing the situation. Based on investigation, we offer re-service at no cost, partial/full refund, or service credit for future bookings. We work with the service provider to understand and resolve the issue to prevent similar problems in future."

          question: "Is my home safe with your service providers?",

All service providers are covered under our comprehensive insurance policy that protects against any damage or theft during service. GPS tracking allows you to monitor service provider location and movement, with live updates sent to your phone. We have 24/7 emergency helpline and panic button feature in app for immediate assistance during any uncomfortable situations. Service providers follow strict safety protocols including wearing ID badges, following hygiene standards, and maintaining professional conduct."

          question: "The app is not working properly. What should I do?",
          answer: "Technical issues can be frustrating, but most can be resolved quickly. Close and restart the app completely, then check if your internet connection is stable and working properly. Ensure you have the latest version by checking Google Play Store or Apple App Store for available updates and install them. Go to your device settings, find Nagrik Sewa app, and clear cache/data, then restart the app to refresh all stored data. Restart your phone/tablet completely as this resolves most temporary software conflicts and memory issues. If issues persist, contact our technical support team with your device details."
        },
        {
          question: "I'm not receiving notifications.",
          answer: "Notification issues can prevent you from staying updated. Open Nagrik Sewa app, go to Settings > Notifications, and ensure all relevant notification types are enabled. Check your phone's Settings > Apps > Nagrik Sewa > Notifications and verify that notifications are allowed and not restricted. Ensure your device's Do Not Disturb mode is off, or add Nagrik Sewa to allowed apps during DND hours. Make sure Nagrik Sewa is allowed to run in background (Settings > Battery > Background App Refresh) for timely notifications. Poor network connectivity can delay notifications - ensure you have stable internet connection."
        },
        {
          question: "Why can't I see service providers in my area?",
          answer: "Service availability depends on location and provider network. Enable location services/GPS in your device settings and allow Nagrik Sewa to access your precise location. Double-check that you've entered the correct complete address including area, city, and PIN code in your profile. We're continuously expanding our network - check our service area map or contact support to confirm coverage in your location. Some services may not be available during certain hours - try checking during peak service hours (9 AM - 8 PM). If services aren't available in your area yet, join our waitlist to be notified when we launch services in your locality."
